Beginner Level - Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Beginner Level section of the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This section is designed for those just starting their journey in computer science and programming. Here, you'll find fundamental concepts explained clearly with examples and code implementations.

Who Is This For?

New developers learning programming.

Students taking introductory computer science courses.

Anyone wanting a refresher on data structure basics.

What You'll Learn

We cover the following foundational data structures and algorithms:

1. Arrays

Introduction to arrays.

Common operations (insertion, deletion, traversal).

Example problems and solutions.

2. Strings

String manipulation techniques.

Basic string algorithms (palindrome check, anagram detection).

3. Linked Lists

Singly and doubly linked lists.

Basic operations (insertion, deletion, reversal).

4. Stacks

Introduction to the stack data structure.

Operations (push, pop, peek).

Use cases (expression evaluation, undo functionality).

5. Queues

Queue basics and types (FIFO, priority queue).

Operations (enqueue, dequeue).

Applications in real-world problems.

How To Use This Section
